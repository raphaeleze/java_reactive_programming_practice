   - Request Body: JSON containing recipe details (title, description, ingredients, instructions, tags)

2. **Get All Recipes** *Done
   - Endpoint: GET /recipes
   - Response: JSON array containing all recipes

3. **Get Recipe by ID** *Done

4. **Update a Recipe** 
   - Endpoint: PUT /recipes/{id}

5. **Delete a Recipe** *Done

**Additional Endpoints:**

6. **Search Recipes by Title or Tag** *Done
